## About this repository

Iâ€™m creating this in order to improve my skills on Design Pattern and the following technologies:

- Visual Studio 2022;
- .Net 6;
- C# 10;
- Blazor;
- MudBlazor

Each individual Design Pattern is inside an orphan branch. Starting the project in a standard program and gradually applying the Design Pattern. Checkout a branch to flow the commit to see the changes.

## Design Patterns

**Design patterns** are typical solutions to common problems
in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint
that you can customize to solve a particular
design problem in your code.

## What does the pattern consist of?

Most patterns are described very formally so people can reproduce them in many contexts. Here are the sections that are usually present in a pattern description:

- **Intent** of the pattern briefly describes both the problem and the solution.
- **Motivation** further explains the problem and the solution the pattern makes possible.
- **Structure** of classes shows each part of the pattern and how they are related.
- **Code example** in one of the popular programming languages makes it easier to grasp the idea behind the pattern.
Some pattern catalogs list other useful details, such as applicability of the pattern, implementation steps and relations with other patterns.

### Benefits of patterns

Patterns are a toolkit of solutions to common
problems in software design. They define
a common language that helps your team
communicate more efficiently.

### Classification

Design patterns differ by their complexity, level of
detail and scale of applicability. In addition,
they can be categorized by their intent
and divided into three groups.
